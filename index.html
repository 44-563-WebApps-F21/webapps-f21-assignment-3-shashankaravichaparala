    <h6>Vijayawada</h6>
    <p>Vijayawada is a <b>city</b>in the southeast indian state of <b>Andhrapradesh</b>. It's known for the ornate <b>Kanaka Durga Temple</b>, which sits a top a hill overlooking the <b>city</b>
    </p>
    </p>
        I like this city because the <b>temple and atmosphere</b> is very good in winter seasons.
